    We implemented the above paper in tensorflow version2 using python 3.10.9.

    To extract the entities and understand the relations between them LSTM - Long Short Term Memory Recurrent Neural Networks are used.
    drop_out factor.py has detailed comments to understand the code.

    steps to build the project :
    1. Clone the Repository.
    2. The below requirements are essential to run the code. However, we request you download the dependencies mentioned in requirements.txt file.
        a. Python > = 3.10.4
        b. tensorflow == 2.12
        c. nltk
    3. Run python Relation-Classification-using-Bidirectional-LSTM-Tree
    4. For Exploratory data analysis use Data_analysis.ipynb in a jupyter notebook setting.
